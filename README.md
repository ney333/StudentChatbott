# Building AI Applications with Watson APIs

# Introduction
For this project, you’ll create a Coursera Student Advisor chatbot that can answer both “short tail” and “long tail” questions students might have about Coursera and its learning programs. 
Leveraging what we built during the course, you will create a more advanced and thorough version of the chatbot. 
You will use several Watson AI APIs as you see fit, including Assistant to hold an interactive dialog, and Discovery to answer the “long tail” of questions and recommend learning resources.
